# The Golang OJAI Client for MapR-DB
[English](./README.md) | [Korean](./README_KO.md)

A simple, lightweight library that provides access to MapR-DB.
The client library supports all existing OJAI functionality and is absolutely compatible with Java OJAI connector,
that runs under the MapR Data Access Gateway.

To use the client library, see the examples in the [ojai-examples repository](https://github.com/mapr-demos/ojai-examples/tree/master/golang).
